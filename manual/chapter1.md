## What is web archiving?

Web archiving is the process of recording web resources. Various elements of the website such as HTML, scripts, images, videos, etc. can be recorded to preserve as much of the original resource as possible. By creating dynamic archives that provide a user with the same experience they would have if they accessed the original site, web archives can give much more information than a static screenshot.

Web archives may be utilized by future researchers, historians and the general public.

## Why Autopilot?

Autopilot is a tool that navigates a website similarly to how a human would, doing things like scrolling, clicking buttons, and playing videos. These actions executed through functions called "behaviors." Because Autopilot can go through the technically complicated aspects of a website, it is useful for recording high-fidelity websites. Furthermore, Autopilot is designed to be accessible for anyone to use, and anyone with little javascript knowledge to contribute to. This makes webarchiving available to everyone.

# Autopilot basics
Autopilot uses [behaviors](https://github.com/webrecorder/behaviors/blob/master/manual/behaviors.md) to collect metadata from websites. Behaviors are Javascript modules which perform a series of actions on a webpage in order to collect information.

## Installing Autopilot

To use this project you must first install its dependencies. You can do this via a package manager like [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```
$ yarn install
# or "npm install"
```

To install Autopilot, use Terminal to clone the Webrecorder repository:

**You must be using node 12~**

```
1. `git clone https://github.com/webrecorder/behaviors.git`
2. `cd behaviors`
3. `yarn build-watch`
4. `open new terminal window`
5. `bash scripts/init.sh`
```
If you wish to use this project via Docker, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

```
3. docker-compose build
4. docker-compose up -d
```

The Autopilot instance can be accessed in the browser at `http://localhost:8089`.

# Running Behaviors
1. In order to run the behaviors you will first need to build them:
```
npm run generate-runnable-behaviors
<!-- npm run build-dev -->
```

2. Then, go into the dist directory.
```
cd dist
```

3. In the dist directory you will see behavior files. Open the behavior file you want and copy the code.
```
open [filename]
```

4. Copy all of the behavior code and paste it into the developer console of a webpage. The console can be accessed in Chrome using the shortcut: Option + âŒ˜ + J (on macOS), or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux).

You can also run behaviors using the CLI:

## CLI and API

The cli provides two commands `API` and `behaviors` and each command has its own options.

## Behaviors command

Execute `./bin/cli behaviors -b` to build the behaviors made available. This will build the behaviors using the behavior config file located in the root of this project.

The built behaviors, along with a behavior metadata file (`behaviorMetadata.js`), can be found in the `dist` directory which will be created for you if it does not exist in the root of this project.

## API command

To run the behavior API server execute `./bin/cli api --build-behaviors`.

This will start the API server after all behaviors provided by this project have been built.

If you have already built the behaviors using the `behaviors` command provided by the cli then you may omit the `--build-behaviors` flag.


Some configuration of the API server can be done via the environment variables listed below

* `BEHAVIOR_API_HOST`: the host the api server will use (e.g. 127.0.0.1)
* `BEHAVIOR_API_PORT`: the port the api server will listen on (e.g. 3030)
* `WR_BEHAVIOR_DIR`: path to the directory containing the built behaviors
* `WR_BEHAVIOR_METADATA_PATH`: path to the behavior metadata file
* `BUILD_BEHAVIORS`: should the api server build the behaviors before starting



# Docker
If you would like, you can use Docker to run Autopilot.

To build the wr-behaviors docker image (`webrecorder/behaviors:latest`) execute `docker-compose build`.

The image created is suitable for building behaviors and running the behavior api server.

The default configuration of the image is to run the api server, however you can substitute the default command with any of the cli commands listed previously.

For more information please consult the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files.
